    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate and efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. However, traditional methods of handling product data may be cumbersome and prone to errors. They often involve manual entry and maintenance processes, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. By harnessing the capabilities of Python programming, we can develop a solution that automates tasks such as adding, reading, updating, and deleting product information. This streamlined approach not only enhances data accuracy and reliability but also improves operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kind of operations that we are going to focus on have an acronym: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)."

    "**CRUD** operations represent the four basic functions that are essential to interact with a database or a data storage system. The acronym CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations form the foundation of most applications that store and manipulate data. Understanding CRUD is crucial for developers working on web, software, and database applications. Here's a brief overview of each operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create**: This operation is used to add new records to a database. It involves inserting data into a database table or a data structure. For example, adding a new user to a user database is a Create operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read**: This operation is used to retrieve or read data from a database. It involves querying the database to fetch information based on certain criteria. For example, fetching all the information about a product is a Read operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Update**: This operation is used to modify existing data in a database. It involves updating one or more fields of a database record. For example, changing a user's email address in a user database is an Update operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delete**: This operation is used to remove records from a database. It involves deleting one or more records from a database table. For example, removing a user from a user database is a Delete operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are vital for managing data effectively in any application. They allow applications to perform basic data management tasks, ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and accessible.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Your task is to develop a product information management system for an e-commerce platform that facilitates the creation, retrieval, updation, and deletion of product details, sales data, and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, you will first load the whole dataset into the computer's memory and provide the users an option to choose between the CRUD operations. When the user has made a choice, you will perform the chosen operation by allowing the user to input the required information. When the user is done with their task and chooses to exit the program, you will save the new files in the same folder by overwriting the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description\n",
    "The dataset for this project has been provided in the *filehandler_data.zip* file. It contains data about products for which the unique ID provided is the stock keeping unit or SKU for short. The ZIP file contains a structured collection of sales data and product information organized into a main folder with three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales Data** (*sales_data.csv*): A CSV file that includes sales data for various products over a 14-day period. Each row corresponds to a different product, identified by a *Product_SKU*. The columns *Day1* through *Day14* represent the sales figures for each consecutive day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product Descriptions** (*product_descriptions* folder): This folder contains text files, each corresponding to a specific product identified by the SKU in the filename (e.g., *description_AISJDKFJW93NJ.txt*). These files provide descriptive information about the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product Details** (*product_details* folder): This folder includes JSON files, again with filenames corresponding to product SKUs (e.g., *details_AISJDKFJW93NJ.json*). These files contain detailed attributes of the products, such as specifications, category, pricing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is suitable for analyzing daily sales performance of products, supplemented with detailed product information and descriptions to allow for a comprehensive analysis of sales trends in relation to product attributes and descriptions."

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Define a function named `create()` that collects comprehensive information about a new product from the user, validates the input, and updates the respective dictionaries with product details, sales data, and product descriptions.\n",
    "- The function should accept three parameters:\n",
    "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing existing product details. Each entry maps an SKU to its corresponding product details.\n",
    "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data. Each entry maps an SKU to a list of sales quantities for the last 14 days.\n",
    "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions. Each entry maps an SKU to its corresponding textual description.\n",
    "- The function performs several operations:\n",
    "  - Prompts the user to input the SKU, which must be exactly 13 characters long. If the SKU does not meet this requirement, print an error message and terminate the function without updating any dictionaries.\n",
    "  - Prompts the user to enter sales data for the last 14 days, which must consist of exactly 14 integers. If the input does not meet this criterion, print an error message and terminate the function without updating any dictionaries.\n",
    "  - Collects product details from the user, including name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability. These inputs are required but not subject to specific validation criteria for this function.\n",
    "  - Prompts the user for a product description, which is also required for successful product registration.\n",
    "- If all inputs are validated successfully, the function updates the `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries with the new product information and prints a success message.\n",
    "- Returns a tuple containing the updated `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries in that order.\n",
    "- The function is designed for use when a new product is to be added to the system and requires the caller to pass the current state of the `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries. It returns their updated states, reflecting the addition of the new product.\n"

    "### Recommendations\n",
    "- You can use if-else statements to check the validity of the data inputted by the user.\n",
    "- Use a list comprehension to prepare the sales data before saving it in the dictionary.\n",
    "- Use the previously defined functions to perform the actions after validating user's input.\n",
    "- Provide the data description and requirements to ChatGPT along with the libraries that you are using and ask it to generate code for the function.\n",
    "- If you get stuck somewhere, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you and you can make edits as required."

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Define a function named `update()` that updates product information, including sales data, product details, and product descriptions, for a specified SKU.\n",
    "- The function should provide a menu-driven interface for users to select the type of product data they wish to update and input new values accordingly.\n",
    "- Parameters:\n",
    "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing existing product details, with SKU as keys and details as values.\n",
    "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data, with SKU as keys and lists of sales quantities for the last 14 days as values.\n",
    "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions, with SKU as keys and descriptions as values.\n",
    "- The function begins by prompting the user to enter the SKU of the product they want to update.\n",
    "  - If the entered SKU does not exist in `product_details`, print a message indicating that the SKU was not found and exit the function early.\n",
    "- The function then displays a menu with options to update sales data, product details, product description, or exit the process.\n",
    "  - For updating sales data, the user is prompted to enter new quantities for all 14 days. The input is validated to ensure it consists of exactly 14 integers.\n",
    "  - For updating product details, the user is prompted to enter updated values for product name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability.\n",
    "  - For updating the product description, the user is prompted to enter a new product description.\n",
    "- Each update option validates the corresponding input data before applying the update to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- The function returns a tuple containing the updated `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries in that order.\n",
    "- Usage:\n",
    "  - The function is designed to be called when an existing product's information needs to be updated. It requires the caller to pass the current states of the `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries and returns their updated states after the modifications.\n"

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Define a function named `delete()` that deletes entries for a given SKU from sales data, product details, product descriptions dictionaries, and also deletes corresponding JSON and text files related to the product.\n",
    "- The function should accept four parameters:\n",
    "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data, with SKU as keys.\n",
    "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing product details, with SKU as keys.\n",
    "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions, with SKU as keys.\n",
    "  - `main_folder`: A string representing the location of the main folder containing subfolders for product details and product descriptions, where corresponding JSON and text files are stored.\n",
    "- The function begins by prompting the user to enter the SKU of the product they wish to delete.\n",
    "  - If the SKU does not exist in the `sales_data` dictionary, print a message indicating that the SKU was not found and exit the function early.\n",
    "- The function then proceeds to delete the entries for the specified SKU from the `sales_data`, `product_details`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries.\n",
    "- After successfully removing the entries from the dictionaries, the function attempts to delete the corresponding JSON file (containing product details) and text file (containing product descriptions) from the specified *main_folder*. It constructs the paths to these files based on the SKU and the folder structure.\n",
    "  - If the specified files exist, they are deleted, and a success message is printed.\n",
    "  - If a file does not exist, a message indicating that the file was not found is printed.\n",
    "- The function returns a tuple containing the updated `sales_data`, `product_details`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries.\n",
    "- Usage:\n",
    "  - The function is designed for cases where a product is to be completely removed from the system, including its sales records, details, descriptions, and associated files. It requires the current states of the `sales_data`, `product_details`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries and the path to the *main_folder* as inputs, and returns their updated states after the deletion.\n"

    "- Ensure that the function checks if the given SKU exists in each of the dictionaries before attempting deletion.\n",
    "- Provide the data description and requirements to ChatGPT along with the libraries that you are using and ask it to generate code for the function.\n",
    "- If you get stuck somewhere, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you and you can make edits as required."

    "### Description\n",
    "In this task, learners are tasked with implementing a Python function named `dump_data()` that automates the process of persisting sales data, product details, and product descriptions into structured files within a specified directory. The function should efficiently organize and dump each type of data into its corresponding file format: CSV for sales data, JSON for product details, and plain text for product descriptions. This exercise challenges learners to apply file I/O operations, directory management, and data serialization techniques in Python, ensuring they gain practical experience with data persistence, manipulation, and organization on the filesystem."

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Define a function named `dump_data()` that dumps product details, sales data, and product descriptions into files within a specified main folder.\n",
    "- The function should accept four parameters:\n",
    "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data, with SKU as keys and a list of sales quantities for the last 14 days as values.\n",
    "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing product details, with SKU as keys and details as values. Details include attributes like name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability.\n",
    "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions, with SKU as keys and the textual description of the product as values.\n",
    "  - `main_folder`: A string representing the location of the main folder, which should contain *product_details* and *product_descriptions* subfolders.\n",
    "- The function performs the following operations:\n",
    "  - Dumps the `sales_data` into a CSV file named *sales_data.csv* located in the *main_folder*. Each row in the CSV file represents the sales data for a product, with fields for the SKU and sales quantities for each of the 14 days.\n",
    "  - Dumps each entry in `product_details` into a separate JSON file within the *product_details* subfolder of the *main_folder*. Each file is named after the SKU of the product and contains the details of that product in JSON format.\n",
    "  - Dumps each product description from `product_descriptions` into a separate TXT file within the *product_descriptions* subfolder of the *main_folder*. Each file is named after the SKU of the product and contains the textual description of that product.\n",
    "- Prior to dumping product details and descriptions, the function checks if the respective subfolders exist. If not, it creates them.\n",
    "- Usage:\n",
    "  - The function is designed to persist the current state of sales data, product details, and product descriptions to the filesystem, allowing for data backup and recovery. It organizes the persisted data into a structured directory and file system based on the specified *main_folder* path.\n"

    "### Recommendations\n",
    "- Ensure that you are writing the data down with the same folder structure as the original folder.\n",
    "- You may want to learn more about the `DictWriter()` object from the `csv` library to write the sales data.\n",
    "- Make sure that you open files with a 'w' parameter so that you are overwriting the files and not appending to them.\n",
    "- Provide the data description and requirements to ChatGPT along with the libraries that you are using and ask it to generate code for the function.\n",
    "- If you get stuck somewhere, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you and you can make edits as required."

    "In this task, you will implement a Python function named `user_menu()` to act as the central interface for a product data management system. This function will integrate create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, allowing users to manage product information interactively from the command line. Your implementation should handle data loading from a specified directory, user input processing to select the desired operation, and data persistence upon exit. This exercise aims to reinforce skills in Python related to function definition, user input handling, conditional logic, and file I/O operations, encapsulating them within a practical application for data management.\n"

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a function named `user_menu()` that serves as the primary interface for managing product data, encompassing create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.\n",
    "- The function should accept one parameter:\n",
    "  - `main_folder`: A string that denotes the path to the main folder where the product data files are stored or will be stored.\n",
    "- Tasks performed by the function include:\n",
    "  - Initially loading existing product data from the files located within `main_folder` by invoking a `load_data()` function. It is presumed that `load_data()` returns three dictionaries: `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions`, each representing different facets of the product data.\n",
    "  - Presenting a menu with options for the user to create new product data, read existing data, update current data, delete data, or exit the application.\n",
    "  - Depending on the user's choice, the function calls other specialized functions (`create()`, `read()`, `update()`, `delete()`) and passes the relevant parameters to these functions for the execution of the selected operation.\n",
    "    - For operations involving the creation, reading, and updating of data, it uses the current states of `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions`.\n",
    "    - For the delete operation, it additionally passes the `main_folder` path to specify the location from which the files associated with the deleted product should be removed.\n",
    "  - After the completion of create, update, or delete operations, the function now calls a `dump_data()` function to persist the most recent state of the product data into files within the `main_folder`. This ensures that changes are saved immediately after these operations.\n",
    "  - When the exit option (option 5) is chosen, it makes a final call to `dump_data()` to save the latest product data before printing an exit message and terminating the program loop.\n",
    "- The function is designed to loop continuously, allowing the user to execute multiple operations until the exit option is selected.\n",
    "- It ensures a robust user interaction experience by handling invalid inputs effectively and guiding the user back to the menu options.\n",
    "- Usage scenario:\n",
    "  - The `user_menu()` function acts as the central component of a product data management system. It offers a user-friendly command-line interface for performing CRUD operations on product data and integrates file handling for data persistence. This approach guarantees that all changes to the data are immediately saved and can be accessed in subsequent sessions.\n"
